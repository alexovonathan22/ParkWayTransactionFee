Discussion:

Response: No.

Reason: 

the tranfer charges were made on the advised transfer amount not the Actual amount, thus the disparity.

Remedy:

i could create an extra variable to store the actual fee charge if the biz was not so generous to bear the transfer charge;

then before making any final transfer check if ActualFeeCharge == TransferFeeCharge; 

if it is equal use Transfer Fee charge
else use actual fee charge;

=> On #50030;
if ActualFeeCharge == N50;
and calculated or transfer fee charge == 25 because (50030 - 50 = 49980(which has transfer charge of N25));

use ActualFeeCharge instead;
this will make the debit amount == expected amount;
